# College_Event_Form

A sample of college event form

Hello Coders!!

I provide you a simple college event form using FRONT-END languages like HTML & CSS

To run this code efficiently, please follow all these instructions:

1. First of all, understand the code and take a look at the structure of the code.
2. Simply copy this code and use any IDE like VS Code to run it smoothly.
3. When you understand the code, you will notice that I've added some images to make it look creative.
4. Here are the images you need to download/upload and add in your code:
   - Your college symbol image.
   - Main header image (e.g., your college event symbol — optional).
   - A creative image for the background that matches your event theme.
   - A video at the end that gives a glimpse of the event.
5. Use icons to make it look more official (use free icons from Font Awesome — refer to YouTube tutorials).
6. Use web3forms to get form submissions dropped to your Gmail (refer to YouTube tutorials to learn how).
